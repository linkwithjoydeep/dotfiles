# Test-Driven Development

TDD is the red → green loop. This skill is the reference that makes that loop produce tests worth keeping: what a good test is, where tests go, the anti-patterns, and the rules of the loop. Every section applies on every cycle: consult them before and during the loop, not after.

When exploring the codebase, read `.scratchpad/<topic-slug>/glossary.md` (if it exists) so test names and interface vocabulary match the project's domain language, and respect anything in `.scratchpad/<topic-slug>/decisions/`. Also read the repo's own `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, and `docs/adr/` if they happen to exist — none of these are required.

## Resolving the topic

Every skill in this set works inside `.scratchpad/<topic-slug>/`. Resolve `<topic-slug>` before doing anything else, in this order:

1. **The user named it.** `/tdd partial-refunds` → use `partial-refunds`. If that folder doesn't exist, say so and confirm before creating it.
2. **The user described it in the invocation.** `/tdd adyen migration` → read `.scratchpad/INDEX.md` and match against existing topics. On a confident match, state which one you picked and continue. On an ambiguous match, list the candidates and ask.
3. **This conversation already established one.** If an earlier turn worked in a topic, stay in it. Don't re-derive or silently switch.
4. **Infer from the repo state.** Check the current git branch name against topic slugs in `INDEX.md` (a branch `feat/partial-refunds` implies the topic `partial-refunds`). For skills that read a diff, also check recent commit messages.
5. **Nothing matched.** Read `INDEX.md` and show the user the topics that exist, most recent first, and ask which one — or offer to start a new one. Never guess, and never write into a topic you picked without saying so.

State the resolved topic in your first line of output, so a wrong guess is caught immediately rather than after files are written: "Working in `.scratchpad/partial-refunds/`."

**Creating a new topic** is `/shape`'s and `/wayfinder`'s job by default — they're the entry points. Other skills can create one, but should confirm first, because a new topic folder appearing mid-chain usually means the slug was resolved wrong.

## What a good test is

Tests verify behavior through public interfaces, not implementation details. Code can change entirely; tests shouldn't. A good test reads like a specification: "user can checkout with valid cart" tells you exactly what capability exists, and it survives refactors because it doesn't care about internal structure.

## Seams: where tests go

A **seam** is the public boundary you test at: the interface where you observe behavior without reaching inside. Tests live at seams, never against internals.

**Test only at pre-agreed seams.** Before writing any test, write down the seams under test and confirm them with the user. No test is written at an unconfirmed seam. You can't test everything, so agreeing the seams up front is how testing effort lands on the critical paths and complex logic instead of every edge case.

Ask: "What's the public interface, and which seams should we test?"

If `.scratchpad/<topic-slug>/spec.md` exists, its Testing Decisions section already names the agreed seams — use those rather than re-litigating them.

When the shape of that interface is itself in question (how deep the module is, where the seam belongs, what the interface should expose), consult `/module-design` for the vocabulary. It is the shared source of the module, interface, depth, seam, adapter, leverage and locality terms, and it is a reference to consult, not a session to run.

## Anti-patterns

- **Implementation-coupled**: mocks internal collaborators, tests private methods, or verifies through a side channel (querying the database instead of using the interface). The tell: the test breaks when you refactor but behavior hasn't changed.
- **Tautological**: the assertion recomputes the expected value the way the code does (`expect(add(a, b)).toBe(a + b)`, a snapshot derived by hand the same way, a constant asserted equal to itself), so it passes by construction and can never disagree with the code. Expected values must come from an independent source of truth: a known-good literal, a worked example, the spec.
- **Horizontal slicing**: writing all tests first, then all implementation. Bulk tests verify _imagined_ behavior: you test the _shape_ of things rather than user-facing behavior, the tests go insensitive to real changes, and you commit to test structure before understanding the implementation. Work in **vertical slices** instead: one test → one implementation → repeat, each test a **tracer bullet** that responds to what the last cycle taught you.

## Rules of the loop

- **Red before green.** Write the failing test first, then only enough code to pass it. Don't anticipate future tests or add speculative features.
- **One slice at a time.** One seam, one test, one minimal implementation per cycle.
- **Refactoring is not part of the loop.** It belongs to the review stage (see `/review-changes`), not the red → green implementation cycle.

## Good and bad tests

### Good

**Integration-style**: test through real interfaces, not mocks of internal parts.

```typescript
// GOOD: Tests observable behavior
test("user can checkout with valid cart", async () => {
  const cart = createCart();
  cart.add(product);
  const result = await checkout(cart, paymentMethod);
  expect(result.status).toBe("confirmed");
});
```

Characteristics:

- Tests behavior users/callers care about
- Uses public API only
- Survives internal refactors
- Describes WHAT, not HOW
- One logical assertion per test

### Bad

**Implementation-detail tests**: coupled to internal structure.

```typescript
// BAD: Tests implementation details
test("checkout calls paymentService.process", async () => {
  const mockPayment = jest.mock(paymentService);
  await checkout(cart, payment);
  expect(mockPayment.process).toHaveBeenCalledWith(cart.total);
});
```

Red flags:

- Mocking internal collaborators
- Testing private methods
- Asserting on call counts/order
- Test breaks when refactoring without behavior change
- Test name describes HOW not WHAT
- Verifying through external means instead of interface

```typescript
// BAD: Bypasses interface to verify
test("createUser saves to database", async () => {
  await createUser({ name: "Alice" });
  const row = await db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = ?", ["Alice"]);
  expect(row).toBeDefined();
});

// GOOD: Verifies through interface
test("createUser makes user retrievable", async () => {
  const user = await createUser({ name: "Alice" });
  const retrieved = await getUser(user.id);
  expect(retrieved.name).toBe("Alice");
});
```

**Tautological tests**: expected value restates the implementation, so the test passes by construction.

```typescript
// BAD: Expected value is recomputed the way the code computes it
test("calculateTotal sums line items", () => {
  const items = [{ price: 10 }, { price: 5 }];
  const expected = items.reduce((sum, i) => sum + i.price, 0);
  expect(calculateTotal(items)).toBe(expected);
});

// GOOD: Expected value is an independent, known literal
test("calculateTotal sums line items", () => {
  expect(calculateTotal([{ price: 10 }, { price: 5 }])).toBe(15);
});
```

## When to mock

Mock at **system boundaries** only:

- External APIs (payment, email, etc.)
- Databases (sometimes — prefer a test DB)
- Time/randomness
- File system (sometimes)

Don't mock:

- Your own classes/modules
- Internal collaborators
- Anything you control

### Designing for mockability

At system boundaries, design interfaces that are easy to mock:

**1. Use dependency injection**

Pass external dependencies in rather than creating them internally:

```typescript
// Easy to mock
function processPayment(order, paymentClient) {
  return paymentClient.charge(order.total);
}

// Hard to mock
function processPayment(order) {
  const client = new StripeClient(process.env.STRIPE_KEY);
  return client.charge(order.total);
}
```

**2. Prefer SDK-style interfaces over generic fetchers**

Create specific functions for each external operation instead of one generic function with conditional logic:

```typescript
// GOOD: Each function is independently mockable
const api = {
  getUser: (id) => fetch(`/users/${id}`),
  getOrders: (userId) => fetch(`/users/${userId}/orders`),
  createOrder: (data) => fetch('/orders', { method: 'POST', body: data }),
};

// BAD: Mocking requires conditional logic inside the mock
const api = {
  fetch: (endpoint, options) => fetch(endpoint, options),
};
```

The SDK approach means:

- Each mock returns one specific shape
- No conditional logic in test setup
- Easier to see which endpoints a test exercises
- Type safety per endpoint
